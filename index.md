What:
-----

A monthly meeting of researchers who are always learning new tips and tricks to
make their computational work flow more smoothly. In these friendly sessions,
peers at all levels of experience share topics useful in our scientific
software development workflows.

This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing off
useful features of a scientific library or programming language you're using,
or bringing up a computational problem you're having.

Who:
-----

Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to come to
our meetings.

Where:
-----

When:
-----

The first Thursday of the month at at 4:00pm. While the main talk should occupy
less than an hour, the lightning talks and hacking session can go on until
6:00pm or later. See the [upcoming topics list]({{ site.url }}/upcoming.html)
or the [calendar](http://bit.ly/1cqFKuh) for the topic for this week.


How:
-----

Participating is really easy.
<li>At **4:00pm**, we gather and go through a round of introductions.  New
  faces are always appearing!</li>
<li>Next, a volunteer will give a **tutorial** or lead a **discussion** about a
  computational topic. This topic can be anything useful, new, or interesting
  to scientists who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked
  up in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love,
  an overview of a useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy
  learning.</li>
<li>Finally, there will be a time for a couple of **Lightning Talks**, which
  are 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or question of
  interest to the group. **Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way
  to bring a question to the group. If you have a bug you need help with,
  here's the place to ask many ears about it at once.
</li>

The Hacker Within relies on peer-driven teaching, so please volunteer to give
one of these talks. To do so, just ping the listhost by email at
[thehackerwithin@ucdavis.edu](mailto:thehackerwithin@ucdavis.edu).


Why:
------

The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility,
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail to
make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version control,
automated documentation, and others.

To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best
practices for computational scientific applications. This group is modeled
after The Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison and is now reborn as a collection of such
chapters around the world. Each of the chapters convenes a community of
scientists, at all levels of their education and training, to share their
knowledge and best practices in using computing to accomplish their work.
